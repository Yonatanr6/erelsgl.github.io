A [double auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_auction) is an auction in which
there are many buyers and many sellers of several commodities, like in stock markets.
The rules of a double auction should guarantee *truthfulness* - each buyer and seller
should be best-off when acting according to his/her true valuations of the items. You should
not need to spy over the other agents in order to know what their valuations are.
There are efficient truthful double-auction mechanisms for single item-types.
Our goal is to develop mechanisms for multiple item-types.
