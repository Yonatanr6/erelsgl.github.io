As the world becomes more crowded, methods for fair division of land are needed. 
Divisions have been studied in two different disciplines:

* **Economists** emphasize the personal *value* that each agent assigns to each piece of land.
In the [Fair cake-cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_cake-cutting) research, each piece should have a sufficiently high value, according
to the personal "value function" of the agent receiving it. But, they usually pay no attention to the geometric *shape* of the pieces.
* **Geometers** emphasize the geometric *shape*.
In the [Polygon partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_partition) research, each piece should be a square, a rectangle or another simple shape. 
But, they pay no attention to the different *value* of the pieces.

Combining these two approaches leads to interesting discoveries.
