In my M.Sc. thesis, I developed a
**probabilistic morphological analyzer for Hebrew texts**.
This was the first Hebrew morphological analyzer.
[The thesis (in Hebrew) is available here][1].

A more recent project I participated in was 
**Hebrew random-text generator**.
[It is used to create automatic understanding-exams][2].
