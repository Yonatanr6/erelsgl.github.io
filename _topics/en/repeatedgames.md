Repeated games explain how cooperation between selfish players is created, thanks to the possibility
of punishing a "bad" player in future plays of the same game. There are many
[folk theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_theorem_%28game_theory%29) that explain this 
cooperation in various settings, but, they all ignore the risk attitude of the players. By generalizing the 
repeated games model to players that have [ordinal utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_utility) functions,
we can extend the folk theorems to players with different risk attitudes.
