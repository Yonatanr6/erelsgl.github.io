The Bible is the inspiration to my diverse research interests.

While preparing pupils for the Bible-quiz, I thought it could be good
to have the computer automatically generate questions. This lead to
my M.Sc. research on [Hebrew NLP][T5] and later to [English NLP][T4].

Studying the laws of Jubilee and land division lead to my Ph.D. research
on [fair division of land][T1] and later to [general mechanism design][T2] and
[game theory][T3].

Some of my Bible-related open-source projects:

* [Textia][P4] - a "wiki-game", a game that anyone can edit.
* [â€ŽTanakh Navigation Kit][P5] - Biblical tables and a regular-expression search engine.
* My [Tanakh Navigation Site][1].
* My [Hebrew Wikisource user page][2].
