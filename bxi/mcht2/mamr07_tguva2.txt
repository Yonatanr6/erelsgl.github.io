Dear colleague,

   On behalf of the Program Committee of the MT Summit Workshop on
Machine Translation for Semitic Languages, we are pleased to inform
you that your submission to the conference has been accepted.
Congratulations!

   Below, you will find a copy of the Comments to the author(s) which
the reviewers have provided for your paper. We suggest you read the
comments and try, if possible, to incorporate the suggested changes in
order to further improve your paper.

   Please note that the deadline for the submission of the final
version of your paper is JULY 31, 2003. By that date, we must receive
a copy of your paper in TWO FORMS: 1) an electronic version (either in
PDF or RTF/MS-Word format); and 2) a camera-ready printed version. We
cannot guarantee that papers received after July 31 will be printed in
the Proceedings. Instructions to authors on how to format their
submissions will be posted on the conference Web site. It is your
responsibility to ensure that your paper conforms to those
instructions. Also note that the maximum number of pages of the camera
ready version of your paper is 8 pages.

   Finally, we would ask you to confirm your intention to present your
paper at the Summit in New Orleans by sending me an email to that
effect as soon as possible, and no later than JULY 14. (Please include
your Summit submission number in the subject field.) We remind you
that you must register for the conference in order to present your
paper. Unfortunately, we are unable to waive registration fees for the
authors of accepted papers.

   Should you have any further questions, feel free to contact any of
us.

   We look forward to seeing you in New Orleans!

   Best regards,
   Violetta Cavalli-Sforza, Alon Lavie and Nizar Habash

===== Review 1/4 =====

This work is publishable but there are two problems with it in the
context of this conference. First of all, the importance of the work
in relation to MT is not addressed in the paper, so in its current
form it is not clearly related to the theme of this
conference. Second, the paper needs more careful structuring, and the
formatting must be tidied up. References must be completed and the
appendices have to be tied in more closely with the text.

===== Review 2/4 =====

It would be desirable to actually compare HMM performance on this
(very small) training corpus.

Evaluation: baseline - memory based system with a default rule of most
common tag for unseen words?

1.1 - Orly Albeck reference should include year.

3.1 - The rule box is not clear (what does 'its' refer to?). Example
at top of page 4 helps, but this could be fixed.

The example below the rule box is not clear. Specify the starting
values for the competing analyses.

How are the numerical weights chosen, and from what set of possible
values?

4 - More details on the parser, in particular performance, would be
useful. How was the handcrafted grammar evaluated?

5 - The scores start off as probabilities, but clearly after the
transformations they are no longer probabilities. The morphological
score seems heuristic, and the syntactic score is certainly
heuristic. The trade-off between these scores should be better
explained.

What weight is used? How was this weight found?

6 - Give details on statistical test. Which test was used?

Table 1: what is the statistical significance of 'Yes No Yes' vs. 'Yes
Yes Yes'? Is the pair stage motivated if the sentence stage can be
more easily improved?

7 - Give details of error analysis

===== Review 4/4 =====

This paper describes a system which performs morphological
disambiguation of Hebrew. While the techniques used by the system are
not novel, the adaptation of existing technology to a language with
rich morphology (and problematic orthography) such as Hebrew is
important and deserves publication. The reported results are also very
promising.

While the paper is in general well-structured and quite clear, there
are a few severe problems of presentation. In particular, the
algorithms are described too briefly, and in certain cases are simply
omitted.

For example, the single paragraph in section 2 leaves the "word stage"
completely unexplained. In section 1 you say that you "approximate,
for each possible analysis, the probability that it is the correct
analysis, independent of the context". How can this be done with an
annotated corpus of less than 5000 forms? What kind of approximation
do you use?

Section 3, the "pair stage", is much better explained. What is missing
is a better description of the patterns used for specifying
transformation rules. It looks like you have a formal language for
defining patterns - why don't you explicate it? The learning algorithm
in section 3.2 requires more detail.

The "sentence stage" described in section 4 also is puzzling. Did you
implement a parser for Hebrew or just a CFG for language, using an
off-the-self parser for CFGs? Is a CFG really needed for this task?
You say that "There are about 10 nontrminals" in the grammar, "one for
each basic part-of-speech". If there are no other non-terminals, the
grammar is not recursive and hence its language is finite. Why don't
you simply use a finite-state parser with hand-crafted short context
rules, as alluded to in section 7?

As for the evaluation: you never specify the baseline. You say that
after the pair stage, "93.8% of the words on average are assigned
their correct analysis". What is the performance after the word stage?
Also, how do you determine the correct analyses? If this is done using
the 4900 word manually annotated corpus, then I suspect that the
results may be biased. Finally, please specify whenever you use
"words" in this context whether you mean types or tokens. What is the
performance in terms of word types?

Also relevant for evaluation: you never compare your work with the
results reported in two other papers which attempt to solve the same
problem: Levinger at al. (1995), which you cite, and Carmel and Maarek
(1999), which you don't. This is a major drawback which has to be
fixed in the final version of the paper.

Minor comments:

Section 1, 2nd paragraph, "In Hebrew..." - Hebrew is not special in
this sense.
Same paragraph - how do tags correspond to POS tags in English, and
what's the relation to Kempe?
Page 2, first line: "is" -> "are"
Page 2, line 3, "yield in" -> "yield"
Page 2, line 4: "It does so..." - who does so?
Page 2, line 5: "is much smaller" -> "much smaller"
Section 1.1, line 5: "so we used" -> "we used"
Section 1.1, 2nd paragraph: what's the point in a literature survey if
you don't relate it to your work? Also, carmel:maarek:99 is missing -
please cite it and discuss the differences from your approach.
Section 1.2, line 2: "all the morphological information" - define!
Section 2, line 1: "the similar words algorithm" - what is it?
Section 2, line 2: "the sparseness" -> "the data sparseness"
Page 2, last line: remove the reference to a pc.
Page 3, middle: "ungrammatical" -> "unlikely"
Section 3.2, penultimate sentence: what is N?
Section 3.2, last sentence: this sentence has no meaning. Remove it.
Section 5, line 5: "if" -> "If"
Section 5, second bullet: I didn't understand the idea.
Section 6, first line: "analysis has been" -> "analyses have been"
Section 7, line 2: how do you see from the error analysis "that there
is still a lot to be done"?
Section 7, line 5: "is creating" -> "are creating"
Bibliography: please use s decent style. A year is missing in "Albeck";
details are missing in "Kempe". The lines in my version were cut.
Appendices: I don't think they're needed.
