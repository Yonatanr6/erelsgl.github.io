# Erel Segal-Halevi - Academic Homepage

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Bar-Ilan University computer-science department. 
My advisors are [Prof. Yonatan Aumann][ya] and [Dr. Avinatan Hassidim][ah]. 

My research interests are diverse and range from theory to practice. Currently I do research in **computational economics** ([fairness][1],  [auctions][2] and [game theory][3]). In the past I did research in **natural language processing** ([English negotiation][4] and [Hebrew morphology][5]). 
The inspiration to research these diverse topics comes from the [Bible][7].

In addition to research, I have many years of experience [programming in various languages][6].
