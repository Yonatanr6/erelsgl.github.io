Welcome to my academic homepage! I am Erel Segal-Halevi, a Ph.D. student in the computer-science department in Bar-Ilan university. 

My research interests are multi-disciplinary and range from theory to practice. Currently I do research in **computational economics** (specifically [fairness][1],  [auctions][2] and [game theory][3]). In the past I did research in **natural language processing** (specifically [English negotiation][4] and [Hebrew morphology][5]). 

I am also a [highly multilingual programmer][6].
