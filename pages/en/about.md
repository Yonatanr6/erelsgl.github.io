# Erel Segal-Halevi - Academic Homepage

I am a new lecturer in Ariel university, computer science department.

Before that I was visiting and doing some research projects in the [Federmann Center for the Study of Rationality][ratio].
At 2016-12 I submitted my [Ph.D. thesis][phd] to the [Bar-Ilan University Computer-Science Department][biucs], where
my advisors were [Prof. Yonatan Aumann][ya] and [Prof. Avinatan Hassidim][ah]. 
Currently 

My research interests are diverse and range from theory to practice. Currently I do research in **computational economics** ([fairness][1],  [auctions][2] and [game theory][3]). In the past I did research in **natural language processing** ([English negotiation][4] and [Hebrew morphology][5]). 
The inspiration to research these diverse topics comes from the [Bible][7].

For some open questions I find particularly interesting, see my [wishlist][8].

In addition to research, I have many years of experience [programming in various languages][6].
