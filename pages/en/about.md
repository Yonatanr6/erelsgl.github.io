# Erel Segal-Halevi - Academic Homepage

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the computer-science department in Bar-Ilan university. 

My research interests are diverse and range from theory to practice. Currently I do research in **computational economics** ([fairness][1],  [auctions][2] and [game theory][3]). In the past I did research in **natural language processing** ([English negotiation][4] and [Hebrew morphology][5]). 

I am also a [highly multilingual programmer][6].
