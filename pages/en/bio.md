**2013-2016 (present)** I am a Ph.D. student in Bar-Ilan University. 
My advisors are [Prof. Yonatan Aumann][ya] and [Dr. Avinatan Hassidim][ah]. 
I research 
[fair division of land][1],

and 
[repeated games][3].

**2010-2013** I worked as a research assistant in Bar-Ilan University

[negochat][4] project - negotiation agents understanding natural language.

**2007-2010** I worked in TROS - a startup company that developed
a patented algorithm for calculating trust in social networks.

**2004-2007** I learned for a computer-science-teaching diploma
and made a living as a freelance website builder.

**1999-2004** I served in the IAF software unit and developed
some secret statistical data-fusion algorithms.

**1993-1999** I did B.Sc. and M.Sc. in computer science, in the Technion.
In my M.Sc. thesis, I build the first morphological analyzer for 
modern Hebrew.
