In parallel to research, I love to learn new programming languages and technologies. 
Here are some of my recent acquisitions and what I did with them.

1. [Jekyll][J1]: this website, with [bilingual support][J2].

2. [SageMath][S1] and Python: an [automatic prover][S2] for our [envy-free cake-cutting algorithm][S3].

3. [Node.js][N1]: **[limdu][N2]** - a machine-learning framework, used for natural-language understanding in the [negochat][N3] system.
**[computational-geometry][N4]** - implementation and demonstration of square-covering, maximum disjoint set, and 2-D cake-cutting.
