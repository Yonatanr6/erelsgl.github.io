This is a list of questions and topics I would like to research.
If you are interested and want to collaborate, drop me an email.

# Research topics

1. **Experiments in [fair division][1]**. I have some simulation results on fair division of land, 
and an online game for experiments with humans on fair cake-cutting. I need partners to 
advance.

2. **Implementing [fair division][1] algorithms in real-estate projects**. 
Currently, apartments are divided by lottery and/or protection... There are 
better ways and I would like to check how they can be implemented.

# Open Questions
I would very much like to know the answer to the following questions.

## Fair Division

1. **Is it possible to find an envy-free and proportional cake-allocation in bounded time?** 
See the Wikipedia page I wrote on [envy-free cake-cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envy-free_cake-cutting) for more information.

2. **Does there always exist a Pareto-efficient envy-free allocation of "family goods"?**
See [my economics.SE question](http://economics.stackexchange.com/q/9916) for more information.

## Geometry

3. **Is it possible to divide the unbounded two-dimensional plane "fair-and-square"?** 
See our fair-and-square papers ([extended abstract](http://erelsgl.github.io/publications/fairness/FairAndSquare-EuroCG-16.pdf) and [full preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03170)) for more information.

4. **What is the minimal number of rectangles required to complete a partial-rectangular-allocation to a full partition?**
See [my cstheory.SE question](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/33744) for more information.
