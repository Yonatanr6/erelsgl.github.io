This is a list of questions and topics I would like to research.
If you find any of them interesting, drop me an email.

# Working papers
These papers need collaborators to realize their full potential:

1. [Fair cake-cutting among groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03903): This paper is mostly economic, with some algorithmic content. It is about fair division of resources that are enjoyed by a whole group, such as a family or a country, rather than by a single individual. I am looking for a collaborator to improve and add new results.

2. [How to re-divide a cake fairly?](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00286): This paper combines computational geometry with economics and social choice. I am looking for experts in any of these fields in order to verify and improve the results.

3. [Cutting a cake without harming the topping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00960): This is a purely geometric paper, although it is motivated by the cake-redivision problem. I am looking for extensions to the results in this paper, and also for ideas where it can be published.

# Reasearch projects

1. **Experiments in [fair division][fairness]**. I have some simulation results on fair division of land, 
and an online game for experiments with humans on fair cake-cutting. I need partners to 
advance.

2. **Implementing [fair division][fairness] algorithms in real-estate projects**. 
Currently, apartments are divided by lottery and/or protection... There are 
better ways and I would like to check how they can be implemented.

# Open Questions 
I would very much like to know the answer to the following questions.

1. **Given a collection of water-pools in an unbounded desert, what is the largest possible collection of pairwise-disjoint wet-squares?**
See [this draft][wet-squares] for formal statement and some directions. This is a purely geometric function, but it is inspired by the following economics question -

2. **Is it possible to divide the unbounded two-dimensional plane "fair-and-square"?** 
See our fair-and-square papers ([extended abstract][fairness-eurocg] and [full preprint][fairness-arxiv]) for details.

3. **Is it possible to find an envy-free and proportional cake-allocation in bounded time?** 
See the Wikipedia page I wrote on [envy-free cake-cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envy-free_cake-cutting) for background and our [waste-makes-haste paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02599) for current status.

4. **Does there always exist a Pareto-efficient envy-free allocation of "family goods"?**
See my [economics.SE question](http://economics.stackexchange.com/q/9916) for details and our [group cake-cutting paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03903) for a related problem.

5. **What is the price of partial-proportionality?** See the Wikipedia page I wrote on [price of fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_fairness) for background. 
The price of full-proportionality is very large - it goes to infinity when there are many partners. But if we only require partial-proportionality, the price-of-fairness 
becomes a constant independent of the number of partners. Is this also true when the pieces must be connected?
