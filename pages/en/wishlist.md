This is a list of questions and topics I would like to research.
If you find any of them interesting and would like to collaborate, drop me an email.

# Working papers
These papers need co-authors in order to realize their full potential:

1. [Fair cake-cutting among groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03903): Mostly related to economics but contains some algorithmic content. It is about fair division of resources that are enjoyed by a whole group, such as a family or a country, rather than by a single individual. I am looking for a collaborator to improve and add new results.

2. [How to re-divide a cake fairly?](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00286): Combines computational geometry, combinatoris, economics and social choice. I am looking for experts in any of these fields in order to help verify and improve the results.

3. [Cutting a cake without harming the topping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00960): A purely geometric paper. I am looking for extensions to the results in this paper and for ideas about where it can be published.

4. [A Tradeoff Between Fairness and Efficiency in Cake-Cutting](http://erelsgl.github.io/papers/FairnessEfficiencyTradeoff-04.pdf): Motivated by economics, but the techniques are mostly combinatorial. A collaborator who is proficient in combinatorics will surely find new results easily.

# Reasearch projects

1. **Experiments in [fair division][fairness]**. I have some simulation results on fair division of land, 
and an online game for experiments with humans on fair cake-cutting. I need partners to 
advance.

2. **Implementing [fair division][fairness] algorithms in real-estate projects**. 
Currently, apartments are divided by lottery and/or protection... There are 
better ways and I would like to check how they can be implemented.

# Open Questions 
I would very much like to know the answer to the following questions.

1. **Given a collection of water-pools in an unbounded desert, what is the largest possible collection of pairwise-disjoint wet-squares?**
See [this draft][wet-squares] for formal statement and some directions. This is a purely geometric function, but it is inspired by the following economics question -

2. **Is it possible to divide the unbounded two-dimensional plane "fair-and-square"?** 
See our fair-and-square papers ([extended abstract][fairness-eurocg] and [full preprint][fairness-arxiv]) for details.

3. **Is it possible to find in bounded time an envy-free and proportional cake-division with connected pieces?** See the Wikipedia page I wrote on [envy-free cake-cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envy-free_cake-cutting) for background and our [waste-makes-haste paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02599) for current status.

4. **Does there always exist a Pareto-efficient envy-free allocation of "family goods"?**
See my [economics.SE question](http://economics.stackexchange.com/q/9916) for details and our [group cake-cutting paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03903) for a related problem.

[//comment]: # 5. **What is the price of partial-proportionality?** See the Wikipedia page I wrote on [price of fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_fairness) for background and my  [fairness-efficiency-tradeoff paper](http://erelsgl.github.io/papers/FairnessEfficiencyTradeoff-04.pdf) for details.
