This is a list of questions and topics I would like to research.
If you find any of them interesting and would like to collaborate, drop me an email.

# Working papers
These papers need co-authors in order to realize their full potential:

1. [Fair cake-cutting among groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03903): Mostly related to economics but contains some algorithmic content. It is about fair division of resources that are enjoyed by a whole group, such as a family or a country, rather than by a single individual. A collaborator could help to improve and add new results.

2. [How to re-divide a cake fairly?](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00286): Combines computational geometry, combinatoris, economics and social choice. I am looking for experts in any of these fields in order to help verify and improve the results.

3. [A Tradeoff Between Fairness and Efficiency in Cake-Cutting](http://erelsgl.github.io/papers/FairnessEfficiencyTradeoff-04.pdf): Motivated by economics, but the techniques are mostly combinatorial. A collaborator who is proficient in combinatorics will surely find new results easily.

# Reasearch projects

1. **Experiments in [fair division][fairness]**. I have some simulation results on fair division of land, 
and an online game for experiments with humans on fair cake-cutting. I need partners to 
advance.

2. **Implementing [fair division][fairness] algorithms in real-estate projects**. 
Currently, apartments are divided by lottery and/or protection... There are 
better ways and I would like to check how they can be implemented.

# Open Questions 
I would very much like to know the answer to the following questions.

1. **When value-densities can be both positive and negative, does there always exist a connected envy-free division for 4 or more agents?**
Mainly a question in algebraic topology. May be related to combinatorics.
My [working paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00726) has a solution for 3 agents.

1. **How many cuts are required for cake-cutting when the agents have different entitlements?**
Mainly a combinatorics question. May be related to measure theory and topology.
My [MathOverflow question](http://mathoverflow.net/q/242112) has some preliminary results.

2. **Does there always exist a Pareto-efficient envy-free allocation of "family goods"?**
Mainly an economics question.
My [economics.SE question](http://economics.stackexchange.com/q/9916) has some more details. 
Our [group cake-cutting paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03903) solves a related but easier problem.

3. **Is it possible to find in bounded time an envy-free and proportional cake-division with connected pieces?** 
Mainly an algorithmic question.
The Wikipedia page I wrote on [envy-free cake-cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envy-free_cake-cutting) gives some background.
Our [waste-makes-haste paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02599) presents the current status.

4. **Given a collection of points in the plane, what is the largest possible collection of pairwise-disjoint wet-squares?**
Mainly a geometric question. 
[This draft][wet-squares] presents the question formally and gives some directions.
Our fair-and-square papers ([extended abstract][fairness-eurocg] and [full preprint][fairness-arxiv]) present the economic motivation.
